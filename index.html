	<p>My name is John Joseph Quito and I was born on October 25, 2001 in Manila. From a young age, I was interested in Computer And Games.</p>
	<p>As I grew older, I attended UDM and pursued my passions in BSIT major in Data Science. Along the way, I faced many challenges and obstacles, but I persevered and learned valuable lessons about resilience and determination.</p>
	<p>Some of the highlights of my life include I work part time in Divoria. I also experienced setbacks and disappointments, but these moments helped me grow and learn from my mistakes.</p>
	<p>Today, I am 21 years old and I am BSIT major in Data Science. Looking back on my life, I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that have shaped me into the person I am today.</p>
