		It takes courage to put yourself out there and try new things, especially when it involves performing in front of others. It's understandable that you may have felt embarrassed about your performance as Judas in church. However, it's important to remember that making mistakes and facing challenges is a natural part of the learning process.

Through your experience, you discovered that you were capable of doing things that you didn't know you could do. This realization is a valuable lesson that can be applied to all areas of your life. It's easy to give up on something before even trying, but you never know what you're capable of until you take that first step.

The fear of failure or embarrassment can hold us back, but it's important to push through those feelings and give ourselves the chance to grow and learn. By trying new things, we gain confidence in our abilities and develop skills that we can use to tackle future challenges.

In the case of your experience as Judas, you may have learned some specific skills related to performing in front of others. However, the larger lesson is that you need to try before giving up. This applies to anything in life, whether it's trying a new hobby, pursuing a career change, or making a significant life decision. You may not succeed on the first try, but with perseverance and determination, you can achieve your goals and discover your full potential.

So, don't be afraid to try new things, even if it means facing the possibility of failure or embarrassment. Remember that every mistake is an opportunity to learn and grow, and with each experience, you'll become stronger and more confident in yourself and your abilities.
