	<p>I was full of energy and curiosity. I loved to explore my surroundings and learn new things. Some of my favorite activities included Hit and run, such as playing with toys, reading books, or watching cartoons.</p>
	<p>My family played a big role in my early years, and I have fond memories of spending time with my parents, siblings, and grandparents. We would often  going to the park or having family dinners.</p>
	<p>As I started to develop my language skills, I became more communicative and started to express my thoughts and feelings more clearly. I also started to develop my own personality and preferences, which would shape my interests and hobbies as I grew older.</p>
	<p>Looking back on my toddler years, I realize how important they were in shaping my development and personality. They were the foundation for my future growth and learning, and I am grateful for the experiences and memories I have from that time.</p>
